I'm Luca, a 17-year-old from Germany, passionate about programming. 
I've been coding for three years and have a deep love for backend development. 
In 2023, I completed my Abitur, and now I'm pursuing an apprenticeship as an Software Developer. 
I thrive on creating solutions that make a difference. 
Join me on my journey as I explore the world of programming, share insights, and showcase my projects. 
Let's connect and code together!
